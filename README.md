# window

For some time now i've been using SFML (great work guys btw) and i've mostly been
happy but some things like more OpenGL control werent obvious to integrate (I at
some point wrote like 600 lines of code to do basic handling of compute shaders)
plus I kind of wanted to know how deep down window handling worked even though a
brief look at it some time ago disgusted me of it. So now here I am like a dumbass
trying to code my own library to do just that.

At the time of writing this, I only intend to support the Windows platform and do
not yet have any ideas on what to name this pseudo-future-maybe-library (hence the
simple repository name)

*Note to self that i'll never read again : commit more frequently you dumbass*

**Technically not 0 libraries used, as i use GLEW to load OpenGL functions :disapointed:**

## Section to debate with myself about the title

title idea : simple Windows window manager, abbreviated ``SWWM``, namespace ``sw``

Maybe since i intend to do this alone do like ``myselfFunction`` and make the 
namespace ``my`` (but replacing ``myself`` with my name, ``Function`` with the 
function of the library and ``my`` with a shorthand for my name)

That way i can even generalize + keep the same namespace

But like with my current username it would be like ``diggerWM`` or something

*god i should change my username shouldn't I... \*goes through an existential crisis 
about that\**

well for now i guess i'll keep ``sw`` as namespace (simple window or smth) and the 
library unnamed...
