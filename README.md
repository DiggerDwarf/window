# window

For some time now i've been using SFML (great work guys btw) and i've mostly been
happy but some things like more OpenGL control werent obvious to integrate (I at
some point wrote like 600 lines of code to do basic handling of compute shaders)
plus I kind of wanted to know how deep down window handling worked even though a
brief look at it some time ago disgusted me of it. So now here I am like a dumbass
trying to code my own library to do just that.

At the time of writing this, I only intend to support the Windows platform and do
not yet have any ideas on what to name this pseudo-future-maybe-library (hence the
simple repository name)

*Note to self that i'll never read again : commit more frequently you dumbass*
